`For self-practice and progress`

## 1. Something to do with array
+ **the first edition implements basic functions and operations to manipulate an array of type int**
+ **the second edition aims to use generics and supports dynamic resizing mechanism**
## 2. Stack and queue

+ **Stack is implemented with Array(Second edition) **
+ **first edition of Queue is implemented in 2019/5/10 in the lab, the loop Queue will be implemented in the next step**
+ **the loop queue is implemented and tested(2019/5/11 afternoon in the lab)**

## 3. Linkedlist

+ **linked list finished in 2019/5/14 night in the lab. basic functions are all implemented**
+ **implement stack and queue using linked list (2019/5/15 night in the lab)**
+ **all left work are finished in 2019/5/17 afternoon in the lab**

## 4. Linkedlist and recursion

+ **this part is not suitable for making demonstration coding due to the unspecified demands**
+ **the relevant puzzles could be found in Leetcode**

## 5. Binary Search Tree

+ all three DFS traverse methods(pre-order, in-order, post-order) are implemented both in recursive and non-recursive. (2019/5/21)
+ the BFS(Breadth First Search) method is also implemented using the queue.(2019/5/21)
